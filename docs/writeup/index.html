        The original goal was to shatter the teapot, which was modeled as having a solid center. This created a challenge of visualizing what constraints were broken since a strong majority of constraints were on the inside of the mesh. The first approach was to use Blinn-Phong shading with 50% opacity for only surface trianges. However, this did not work as expected, as demonstrated by the image below.

    <p>
        This problem arises because the triangles in the mesh are in random order

        I did a lot of work on the visualization aspect of this project. I came up with and implemented the two wireframe appearance scehemes, and implemented the Blinn-Phong shading (with corrected normal directions) (minus the cracks shown on the surface, Nicole did that!). I consolidated all the data structures for tetrahedra into one file, and did a little work on the main simulate() loop. I imported open-source code for Perlin Noise, and used it to weaken the constraints as described above. I added a fall height parameters to the UI and implemented it in the simulation side. I added the simulation statistics to the bottom of the UI.
