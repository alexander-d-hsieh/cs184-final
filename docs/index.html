<h1 align="middle">Final Project: Shattering Brittle Objects</h1>

<p>
  This will simulate a brittle object shattering against the ground. 
  We will attempt to realistically simulate objects, such as glass and ceramic, 
  falling to the ground and the ways in which they break. 
</p>

<div>

<h2 align="left">Problem Description</h2>
<p>
  This problem is important because it is hard for animators do draw frame by frame shattering, 
  and it is a common action bothy animation and video games that it should be easily replicated and produced, 
  regardless of initial conditions. Additionally, the shattering effect of a brittle object 
  varies widely depending on the initial conditions of the object as well as the magnitude of the 
  force applied onto the object, so a shattering procedure shouldbe able to produce realistic results 
  regardless of theses parameters. 
</p>

<h2 align="left">Goals and Deliverables</h2>
<h4 align="left">What we plan to deliver</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    A generic brittle object shattering as it is dropped from various different heights, demonstrating our implementation
    of the fracturing algorithm and its responsiveness to different initial conditions and forces. 
  </li>
  <li>
    
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 align="left">What we hope to deliver</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      A simple interactive game or scene that have brittle objects and interactions that will apply a force
      to brittle, causing it to shatter
    </li>
    <li>
      Multiple different brittle material types and rendering demonstrating how the same object made with different
      materials will shatter
    </li>
    
  </ul>

<h2 align="left">Schedule</h2>

<p>
  Week 1:
  <ul>
    <li>Set up GLSL using project 3-2, part 5 as a guide</li>
    <li>Generate a scene with basic physics of an object falling to the ground</li>
    <li>Create or find triangle mesh objects such as saucers, bowls, and glass panes that we want to simulate shattering</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  Week 2:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Work on the algorithm described in the papers below and implement one or more different ways of creating shattering affects,
      ideally having at least one method that is both realistic and fast enough to be rendered in real time
    </li>
    <li>
      Complete the first rendered scene of the utah pot shattering from various different heights
    </li>
    <li>Document progress and create midstone video</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  Week 3:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Create some interactive features in the webGL real time rendering for demo purposes
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  Week 4:
  <ul>
    <li>Finishing touches on project</li>
    <li>Do writeup</li>
    <li>Make video</li>
  </ul>
</p>
